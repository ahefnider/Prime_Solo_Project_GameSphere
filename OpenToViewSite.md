## GameSphere is a single page web app made to solve the problem of having too many games, but nothing to play. Enter all your games from various systems into the library. Use the Giant Bomb API search feature on the "Add a Game" page to view the most recent cover-art and information on the game.


## After your game library is stored in the database, navigate to the "Random Game" tab. This feature will randomly select a game from your library. This is to encourage you to play games you would otherwise ignore or games you may have forgotten about. 



# Feel free to register as a new user to explore the features. You will need to have a few games entered in to use certain features.
